applied AI and AI research 
- applied engineer 

AI roadmap 
- core AI 
    - build Models
- applied AI 
    - building on top of AI apis , AI agents , MCP's 

the Problem 
- new tools dropping every couple of weeks 
- chatgpt , claude , gemini , agents , rag , fine tuning 
- where do you start ? 
- everyone says something different 

Python fundamentals 
- conditional 
- loops 
- classes and objects 
- common libraries 

Classical ML 
- regression / classification 
- clustering 
- evaluation : accuracy , recall , precision , F1 score etc 
- cross-validation , train-test split 

Deep Learning 
- neural network 
- backdrop 
- mlps 
- activation function
- loss function  
- optimizers 
- library - pytorch 

Explore different paths 
- CV ( computer vison )
- NLP natural language processing ( preprocessing )
- RL reinforcement Learning ( MDP's )
- Speech and audio processing 

Transformers 
- internals 
- data flow 
- positional embeddings 
- attention mechanism 
- followed by latest advancements ( MoE's ) 

Large Language Models 
- pre training ( base model , massive data ) 
- mid training ( domain specific knowledge , continual pretraining ) 
- post training ( instruct tuning , RLHF , test time compute ) 

Finetuning 
- making model work best 
- unsloth , TRL 
- LoRa , QLoRA , adapters 

Comparatively Easy Stuff 
- working with LLM api's 
    - prompt engineering 
    - function calling 

Embeddings and vector databases 
- embeddings
- similarity metrics
- indexing 
- retrieval 

RAG 
- document loading , preprocessing
- chunking stratergies 
- reranking 
- hybrid search 
- evaluations 

AI agents 
- anything that can perceive reason and act 
- agent fundamentals 
- tool use / function calling 
- planning , memory 
- multi agent systems 
- frameworks : langgraph , camel etc 

MCP 
- connecting agents to tools via MCP 
- oAuth & authorization 
- DB access , API integration , code execution 

MLOps & Prod 
- experiment tracking 
- Docker k8s
- inference optimization : vLLM , TensorRT , ONNX 
- monitoring 

Takeaway 
- being uptodate with latest research
- always keep on learining new things 
- rapid development - adapt fast 

- start building a project 

- you need to be a rapid developer 
- new tech fast , integrate fast , build project on top of it
