supreme court example 
- you are getting a divorce angry person 
- first you go to  local court , submit some docs and that go sit in some central database 
- if some mishap happens in the local court / high court / supreme court 

what is a database ? 
- it is a place where data is stored persistently 
- servers are transient , database is persistent 

example of data stored in database :- 
- for linkedin 
    - user data 
    - user posts 
    - users connection relationships 
    - messages 

Get me my feed -> express ( does auth checks ) -> give me all posts for this user

good question to have at this point 
-> why don't we let the user hit the database directly ? 
-> 

1 database were are created using protocols that browsers don't understand 
2 databases don't have granual access as a first class citizen . Very hard to do user specific access in them 
3 there are some database(FIREBASE) that let's you get rid of the http server and try their best to provide granola access

Databases usually allow access to 4 primitives 
- create data 
- read data 
- update data 
- delete data 
popularly known as CRUD 

let's see the API for the mongoose library 
- eventually we will be using prisma ( industry standard ) 
- mongoose , first you have to define the schema 
    - counter intuitive 

mongoose -> first step define your schema 

mongodb -> schemaless 

schema -> structure of the data that you are putting there 
- users 
    - email 
    - password
    - firstname
    - city
    - age 

SQL -> structured query language
