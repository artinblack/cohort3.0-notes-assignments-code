basics : typography 
    - typeface is the design of the letters . font refers to a specific style or weight within that typeface ( eg Poppins bold 16px )

            - too loose makes the text disjointed 
            - ideal - 1.5 to 1.75 times the font size is typically ideal . 
        - tracking - letter spacing 
            - 0-3%
            - the space between characters in a block of text , affecting the overall density of text.
        - kerning
            - the space between specific pairs of letters to make the text look more balanced ( e.g A and V in some fonts)

basics : colors 
    - colors play a crucial role in ui/ux design - it enhances mood , draws attention and impacts the overall user experience 
    - color theory 
        - it is the study of how colors interact and the effects they create when combined . parts of color theory are as follows : 
            - color harmony 
            - color value 
            - color temperature 

    - contrast 
        - refers to the difference in luminance or color that makes an object distinguishable from others. 
        - wcag guidlines for accesibility : 
            - for normal text , aim for a contrast ratio 4:5:1 
            - for larger text , a contrast ratio of 3:1 is acceptable 
            - tools like contrast checker ( webAIM ) can help ensure your design meets accesibility standards . 
    -60-30-10 rule 
        - 60 percent - dominant color - this will be the main color of your interface 
            - background or large sections 
        - 30 percent - secondary color - used to add contrast to the dominant color 
            - sidebard , cards , buttons 
        - 10 percent - used sparingly to highlight important actions 
            - cta buttons , icons , links 

introduction to ui/ux 
    - includes visual elements such as buttons , text ,images , entry fields and anything the user can/could interact with 
    - user experience(ux) - includes how a user interacts with and experiences a product 

    - Difference between user interface and user xp 
        - ux without ui is like brain without a body & a ui without ux is like a human without it's brain 
    
    - why ui/ux matters : 
        - first impressions 
            - 50 milliseconds users will judge your website 
        - competitive edge 
            - good ui/ux is often what makes users choose your product over another with similar features 
        - scaling 
            - consistent design helps maintain brand identity as you scale and adapt for new devices . 

    - a solid ui consist of good typography , color theory , breathable spacing , maintaining consistency and responsive design 

User Interface 
    - focuses on the visual aspects of an application , including layout , color schemes , typography  and icons overall aesthetics 
    - hierarchy 
        - it refers to the arrangement of elements in a way that communicates importance and guides users through the interface 
    - consistency
    - white space 
        - the focus for white space is to get attention on the hero page
    - continuity 
        - users tend to perceive elements that are arranged on a line or curve as related

User experience
    - let's discuss some important UX laws : 
        - hick's law
            - principle : the more choices you present , the longer it takes for users to make a decision 
            - application : limit choices and break complex tasks into smaller steps ( e.g multi step forms )
        - fitt's law 
            - principle : the time to reach a target depends on it's size and distance 
            - make buttons large etc 
        - jacob's law 
            - principel : users prefer interfaces that work like those they've already familiar with 
            - e.g cart icon in top-right corner on e-comm sites 
        - miller's law
            - people can hold 7 items in their working memory . 
            - chunk information and avoid overwhelming users with too many details at once . 
        - law of proximity 
            - objects close to each other are perceived as related 
            - e.g form labels with input fields
        - aesthetic usability effect 
            - users perceive visually appealing designs as more usable 
            - prioritize both aesthetic's and functionality to improve user satisfaction

Bento grid
    - compartmentalized compartments 
    - organize content into distinct , modular sections of varying sizes.
