git and github 

what is git ? 
- free and opensource version control system 

what is version control system ? 
- a system that keeps track of our files and projects. 
- it allows you to revert selected files to a previous state, revert the entire project to a previous state, compare changes overtime , see who last modified something so that we can know what might be causing a problem , or what is the issue , who made it , and when with the details 

version control system are of two types 
- centralized 
- distributed 

Helps you backup , track and synchronize the files 
centralized vcs
Main trunk 
    - milk ( + soup ) -> sue 
        - milk,soup (+ juice ) -> joe 
            - milk , soup , juice

distributed vcs 
- all the checkout points are synchronized changes 

why git ? 
- free 
- open source 
- scalable 
- super fast
- cheap branching and merging 

what is github ?
- github is a web-based hosting services for git repositories 
- you can use git without Github , but you cannot use github without git. 

Local repo 
- every vcs tool provides a private workplace as a working copy. Developers make changes in their private workplace and after commit, these changes become a part of the repository. Git takes it one step further by providing them a private copy of the whole repository . Users can perform many operations with this repo such as add file, remove file , rename file , move file , commit changes and many more 

Working directory and staging area or index : An intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit . 

push : send a change to another repository ( may require permission ) 
pull : grab a change from a repository

basic workflow of git 
step 1 : you modify a file from the working directory
step 2 : you add these files to the staging area 
step 3 : you perform commit operation that moves the files from the staging area. After push operation, it stores the changes permanently to the Git repository

git add , git commit 

Blobs - blob stands for binary large object, each version of a file is represented by blob 

Trees - tree is an object , which represents a directory. It holds blobs as well as other sub-directories . A tree is a binary file that stores references to blobs and trees which are also named as SHA1 hash of the tree object. 

Commits - commit holds the current state of the repository . A commit is also named by SHA1 hash 
Commit object - a node of the linked list 
Every commit object has a pointer to the parent commit object 
From a given commit , you can traverse back by looking at the parent pointer to view the history of the commit 
If a commit has multiple parent commits, then that particular commit has been created by merging two branches 

Git basic commmands 
- clone => bring a repo hosted somewhere like github into a folder or your local machine . 
- add => track your files and changes in Git .
- commit => save your files in git . 
- push => upload your commits to a git repo , like Github 
- pull => download changes from a remote repo to your local repo 

git init => initialize a git repository 
git status => getting the current status 
git commit -m "Commit message" => commit to the repository
git remote -v => configure that there is a remote repository for this repo  
git remote add origin "githublink.git" => add the local repo to the remote repo ( or the github repo )
