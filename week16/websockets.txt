- socket io 
- client side code 
- scaling ws servers ( hard than http servers )

websockets 
    - provide a way to establish a persistent , full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection between the client ( typically a web browser ) and the server 

Browser -> first request ( give me sol price ) -> server 
-------------------- persistent connection -------------
server -> sol price is 170.08 -> browser 
server -> sol price is 170.01 -> browser
server -> sol price is 170.12 -> browser

determined to continue doing something even though people say that you are wrong or that you cannot do it

3 way handshake 

persistent connection - websockets , webRTC

TCP - transmission control procotol

OSI model 
    - Highest layer - HTTP , websockets , webRTC  
    - lowest layer  - TCP  , UDP 

websockets under the hood use TCP procotol
webRTC uses UDP 

For real time communication RTC - apko real time me pata lag raha hai ki price kya hai 

http for chat application - polling / long polling 

echo Application 
ping pong application 

frontend is kinda hard in this 
backend is easy in this 

chat application 

scaling web servers 
    - in the real world , you'd want more than one websocket servers ( Especially as your website gets more traffic )
    - the way to scale websocket servers usually happens by creating a ws fleet 
    - there is usually a central layer behind it that orchestrates messages 
    - ws servers are kept stateless 
    
ws servers are kept stateless

another protocol similar to http , 

one time request - in http 

multiple requests and response - two way communication
