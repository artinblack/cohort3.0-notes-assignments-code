What are databases ? 
- databases are organized collections of data that are structured to enable efficient storage, retrieval and management of information 
- your backend stack can be node,go,rust your database stay static 
- some databases are NoSQL , SQL 
- user information
- todo's of your todo app 
- posts for facebook 
- tweets for twitter 

- backend will be stateless : there will be no information stored in backend
- if your server is down then it is okay but if your database is down then you are screwed

Mongodb and NoSQL databases 
- nosql databases are a broad category of database systems that diverge from the traditional relational model used in the SQL database . 
- they are designed to handle a variety of data models and workloads that may not fit nearly into the tabular schema of relational database . 

Mongodb advantages ( nosql ) 
- schema flexibility 
- scalability 

schema => what does the database look like ? 
- todo application 
    - users_table => email : string , password : string , name : string , age : integer 
    - todos_table => title : string , done : boolean , deleted : boolean  

MongoDB is schemaless 

mongodb cluster => bunch of machines that are holding our data is called cluster of machines 

collection => mongodb table 

user collection and todo collection are connected by user id 

whenever you have to create a relationship between collections make sure you have to store the id and not the full name and stuff 

CRUD operations in mongodb refer to the basic operations you can perform on documents within a MongoDB database. CRUD stands for : 
    - Create : Adding new documents to a collection
    - Read : Retrieving documents from a collection 
    - Update : Modifying existing documents in a collection
    - Delete : Removing documents from a collection
