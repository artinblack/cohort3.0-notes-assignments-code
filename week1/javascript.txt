Javascript 

- going to the next page happens via javascript s
- the hover is css 
- the text and the button in the html tag 

Facts/Callouts 

- React and NextJS are frameworks , they compile down to HTML, CSS and JS in the end . That is what your browser understands . 
- if someone asks - what all languages can your browser interpret , the answer is HTML , CSS , JS and WebAssembly . It can , technically , run C++/Rust code that is compiled down to WebAssembly. 

Properties of JS 
- Every language comes with it's unique set of features . 
- Goldman Sachs has it's own language called Slang . 

Javascript has the following :- 
#1 Interpreted : 
- JS is an interpreted language , meaning it is executed line by line at runtime by the Javascript engine in the browser or server environment, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand 

C++ code -----> binary -----> runs on your machine 

JS code -----> runs on your machine 

Upsides :- 
1 there is one less step to do before running your code 
 
Downsides :- 
1 Performance Overhead 
2 More prone to runtime errors 

Typescript will make it closer to javascript , there will be less runtime errors 

#2 Dynamically typed 
- variables in javascript are not bound to a specific data type . Types are determined at runtime and can change as the program executes 
- dynamic type - can change from string to number and vice versa 
    - example : javascript 
- static type - cannot change from string to number 
    - example : cpp 

#3 Single threaded 

- js executes code in a single threaded environment , meaning it processes one task at a time. 
- js code will run line by line on a single thread 

#4 Garbage Collected 

Javascript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through garbage collection , which helps prevent memory leaks by automatically reclaiming memory used by objects no longer in use . 

1 variables - these are used to store data you declare variables using var let or const 

objects 
an object in javascript is a collection of key-value pairs , where each key is a string and each value can be any valid Javascript data type , including another objects 

let user = { 
    name : "Harkirat" , 
    age : 19 , 
}

objects in js => map in C++ => hashmap in rust => hashmap in java 
key value pair
