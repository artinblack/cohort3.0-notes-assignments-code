Step 1 - types of language

1 strongly typed vs loosely typed

- how a programming language handle types , particularly how strict they are about type conversions and type safety 

Strongly typed languages 
- examples :
    - java , c , c++ , rust 
- benefits 
    - lesser runtime errors
    - stricter codebase 
    - easy to catch errors at compile time 

Loosely typed languages 
- examples : 
    - python , javascript , perl , php 
- benefits 
    - easy to write code 
    - fast to bootstrap 
    - low learning curve 

typescript
    - typescript was introduced as a new language to add types on top of javascript
    - developed by microsoft 

ts -> js -> browser / node.js 

tsc is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript 

problem 1 - hello world 


// rootDir 
// outDir 
// noImplicitAny 
// removeComments 


Step 6 - interfaces 
- what are interfaces ? 
    - how can you assign types of objects? For example , a user object that looks like
    - const user = { 
        lastname : "bhagtani" , 
        email : "aashrayasdjfas;kldfj" 
        age : 21
    }
    - to assign a type to the user object , you can use interfaces
    - interface User { 
        firstname : string , 
        lastname : string , 
        email : string , 
        age : number , 
    }

what are types ? 
- very similar to interfaces , types let you aggregate data together
